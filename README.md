# Customer Waitlist
This app manages customer intake by adding them to a wait list. Includes the ability to prioritize customers and alert them via email that they are up for a table.

## Back Story
My friends and I went to this excellent Nashville Fried Chicken restaurant, here in Austin, Texas. Unfortunately, there was an estimated 1 hour wait. We figured we could look in the shops for 40 minutes, set by our watch timers, and then come back and wait the rest of it out. Unfortunately, the estimated time was way off, and since their wait list consisted of pencil and paper, it could not notify clients that they were ready. When we went back, they said our time had passed, but that they would prioritize us. No problem! We waited a bit while before their paper and pencil solution proved once again was not sufficient, as they couldn't properly place us in position. We waited about another 30 minutes until it was time to eat their delicious food. This happening spawned this app's idea.

## Potential Improvements
Some ideas to improve the app more
- Currently you have to enter the email details to send an email and then compile the app. This could be improved by having a page to inter the details.
- Remove emailing all-together and use an SMS service, such as [Twilio.](https://www.twilio.com/sms)
- Statistics page to display some useful numbers over wait times, number of customers waiting, etc.
- Some sort of logo?
- App Start splash screen.
